# Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up PrestaShop in your Docker environment:

### 1. Create the project and copy this repo
At the location of your choice, create a folder a give it your project's name.

Then copy this repo in it.


### 2. Download PrestaShop
Download the desired version of PrestaShop from the [official releases page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases).


### 3. Extract the PrestaShop Files
Unzip the `prestashop.zip` file (found inside the downloaded `prestashop_x.x.x.zip`) directly into the projectâ€™s root directory.

Desired result: a folder named "prestashop" (important) at project's root, containing the Prestashop installation files.


### 4. Configure PHP Settings
Ensure that the `php.ini` file located at the project's root meets PrestaShop's system requirements based on your environment.


### 5. Set Required File Permissions
Verify that the necessary folders and files have the correct permissions:
- They should be **readable**, **writable**, and **executable** by both your host user and the `www-data` group (used by the web server).
- It's recommended to grant ownership to your host user and add the user to the `www-data` group for easier management.

Step-by-step
1. Check current user's groups: `groups $USER`
2. Add www-data group if needed: `sudo usermod -aG www-data $USER`
3. Check current files/folders permissions:
`ls -l` we want: "-rwxrwxr-x  1 {user} www-data 1001 {datetime} {filename}"
4. If changes are needed:
`sudo chown -R {user}:www-data /{projectpath}` & `sudo chmod -R 775 /{projectpath}`


### 6. Ensure Inherited Ownership
Make sure that new files created within the PrestaShop directory inherit the correct group ownership (`www-data`).

`sudo chmod g+s /{projectpath}/prestashop`

`sudo chown -R {user}:www-data /{projectpath}/prestashop`

`sudo chmod -R 775 /{projectpath}/prestashop`

Check result: `ls -l` we want: "drwxrwsr-x 28 {user} www-data 4096 {datetime} prestashop"

The s in drwxrwsr-x confirms setgid is active.


### 7. Build and Start Docker Containers
You probably want to replace the placeholder credentials set in docker-compose.yml before.

Once ready, run the Docker setup:
- Build the containers using `docker-compose build`
- Start the containers using `docker-compose up -d`


### 8. Install PrestaShop
Once the containers are running, access PrestaShop by navigating to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the PrestaShop installation.

Note: when you're asked for database credentials, set the mariasb container's name (as shown by running `docker ps`) as the host instead of the default localhost, since PrestaShop is running inside a container and must connect to the database container.
